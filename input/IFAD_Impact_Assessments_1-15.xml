However, the level of dissemination and adoption of this knowledge is still inadequate, especially among smallholder farmers in developing countries. In an effort to enhance the adoption of such technical innovations and improved practices, agricultural extension approaches like Farmer Field Schools (FFS) have been widely advocated. FFS are usually participatory and informal methods of training and assisting farmers in their own locality, to adopt and adapt new technologies that can improve their farming practices.&#xD;
The ASDP-L and ASSP projects were implemented in Zanzibar between 2007 to 2017, with an aim to contribute towards the Government initiatives to increase agricultural productivity and profitability, generate employment in rural areas and ensure national and household food security. The purpose of the projects was to empower crop and livestock farmers through capacity building and training activities offered in the form of FFS, so as to improve their agricultural production systems.&#xD;
The impact assessment on the ASDP-L and ASSP projects is based on a quantitative household data collected in 2018 from about 2082 FFS participants and non-participants. Information obtained via a qualitative study by the project implementation team was used to support the quantitative survey design and interpretation of results from the quantitative data analysis for this impact assessment. Statistical matching techniques were used in the sampling and data analysis to identify and select a proper comparison group for the FFS participants.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">IMPACT ASSESSMENT</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">LIVESTOCK FARM</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">FOOD SECURITY</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">RURAL DEVELOPMENT</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">SMALL HOLDER</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="773" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="w">IF000016494</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="852" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">E-Lib</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="856" ind1=" " ind2="8"><subfield code="u">http://library2018.ifad.org:8080/16490.jpg</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="856" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="u">https://www.ifad.org/documents/38714170/41117552/TZ_ASDP-L+ASSP_IA+report.pdf/cbdb6bf7-e620-b5f6-15fb-e88d70a25d1a</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="999" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">VIRTUA40</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="999" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">VTLSSORT0010*0030*0080*0350*0390*0900*1000*2450*2600*3000*4900*5200*6500*6501*6502*6503*6504*7730*8520*8560*8561*9992</subfield></datafield></record><record><leader>02541nab a2200337 a 4500</leader><controlfield tag="001">vtls000016500</controlfield><controlfield tag="003">IFAD</controlfield><controlfield tag="005">20190513105600.0</controlfield><controlfield tag="008">190513 2018                  000 0 eng d</controlfield><datafield tag="035" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">IF000016500</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="039" ind1=" " ind2="9"><subfield code="a">201905131056</subfield><subfield code="b">vaids</subfield><subfield code="c">201905131054</subfield><subfield code="d">vaids</subfield><subfield code="y">201905131054</subfield><subfield code="z">vaids</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="090" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">S2256 26 2018 N.2</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="100" ind1="1" ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Garbero, A.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="245" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Agricultural Value Chains Support Project (PAFA)</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="260" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="b">IFAD</subfield><subfield code="c">2018</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="300" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">87 pp.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="490" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">IFAD Impact Assessment</subfield><subfield code="v">2018 N.2</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="520" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Value chain development is an important strategy to achieve sustainable development for smallholder farmers. It focuses not only on farmers and their direct livelihood but recognizes that sustainable agricultural projects ought to consider the entire production process by not only improving the factors of production for smallholder farmers but also allowing for greater integration into local markets, and the strengthening of key stakeholders along the value chain.&#xD;
The Agricultural Value Chains Support Project (in French Projet d’Appui aux Filières Agricoles (PAFA)) capitalizes on the value chain approach to improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in Senegal’s Groundnut Basin. Approved in 2008 and put into effect on February 5th 2010, the Agricultural Value Chains Support Project has, as of today, reached 37,734 households. The project is articulated around five components: (1) agricultural diversification and access to local market (2) development and structuring of regional value chains, (3) national coordination, knowledge management and project management, (4) climate change adaptation, and (5) support services for rural finance. The project was innovative in that, in addition to providing support to farmers through producer organisations (POs), there was an emphasis on improving concertation and collaboration around key value chains.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">IMPACT ASSESSMENT</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">DIVERSIFICATION</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">SMALL HOLDER</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">ECONOMIC GROWTH</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="700" ind1="1" ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Diatta, D.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="700" ind1="1" ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Olapade, M.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="773" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="w">IF000016494</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="852" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">E-Lib</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="856" ind1=" " ind2="8"><subfield code="u">http://library2018.ifad.org:8080/16482.jpg</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="856" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="u">https://www.ifad.org/documents/38714170/41115672/SN_PAFA_IA+report.pdf/0deb15a4-9d3f-de7e-2b56-a2a753cf87dd</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="999" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">VIRTUA40</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="999" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">VTLSSORT0010*0030*0080*0350*0390*0900*1000*2450*2600*3000*4900*5200*6500*6501*6502*6503*6504*7000*7001*7730*8520*8560*8561*9992</subfield></datafield></record><record><leader>04114nab a2200337 a 4500</leader><controlfield tag="001">vtls000016510</controlfield><controlfield tag="003">IFAD</controlfield><controlfield tag="005">20190513143300.0</controlfield><controlfield tag="008">190513 2019                  000 0 eng d</controlfield><datafield tag="035" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">IF000016510</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="039" ind1=" " ind2="9"><subfield code="a">201905131433</subfield><subfield code="b">vaids</subfield><subfield code="y">201905131433</subfield><subfield code="z">vaids</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="090" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">S2256 26 2019 N.2</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="100" ind1="1" ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Arslan, A.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="245" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Coastal Climate Resilient Infrastructure Project (CCRIP):&#xD;

The project is funded by IFAD, the ADB, KfW of Germany, and the Government of Bangladesh. The project aims to improve the connectivity of farms and households in the face of climatic shocks, focusing on one of the most shock-prone areas of one of the most shock-prone countries in the world. The main component of the project is the construction of improved markets and market connecting roads, that are designed to remain useable during the monsoon season. This is expected to improve sales of on-farm produce, along with access to inputs as well as opportunities for off-farm income generation, leading to increased productivity and income. The project also aims to improve women's empowerment by employing Labour Contracting Societies (LCS), consisting mainly of destitute women, to carry out some of the construction work.&#xD;
This impact assessment focuses on the activities funded by IFAD, which includes the strengthening of markets and roads at the community and village levels. Using data from an in-depth household questionnaire covering 3,000 treatment and control households, combined with extensive qualitative interviews, we analyse the project's impact on a range of impact indicators relating to income; crop, fish and livestock production and sales; assets, food security and education; financial inclusion; and women's empowerment. We assess impact on the whole sample, as well as for a range of sub-groups, including by geographic location, location within the market catchment area, and by livelihood activity, integrating findings from the qualitative data to help to explain the mechanisms that shaped the project's impact.&#xD;
Regarding on-farm activities, we find that, despite a lack of impact on productivity, income from selling crops and fish increased significantly (by 104 and 50 per cent, respectively). However, we do not find a similar increase in income from the sale of livestock and livestock products. The lack of impact on productivity was seemingly caused by persisting issues with accessing high-quality inputs during the monsoon season, as well as households having limited capital to purchase these inputs. Despite this, the project increased the amount of produce that was sold, the amount that was sold at a market rather than from home or the farm gate, and increased the likelihood of growing cash crops, leading to the large increase in on-farm income.&#xD;
As well as improving on-farm income, the project also increased income from wage labour, which together produced a positive impact on total income of 11 per cent, along with a four per cent reduction in poverty. This increased prosperity was also reflected in reduced food insecurity and increased ownership of households assets.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">IMPACT ASSESSMENT</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">COAST CLIMATE</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">SUSTAINABILITY</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">INFRASTRUCTURE</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="700" ind1="1" ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Higgins, D.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="700" ind1="1" ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Islam, S.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="773" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="w">IF000016494</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="852" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">E-Lib</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="856" ind1=" " ind2="8"><subfield code="u">http://library2018.ifad.org:8080/16492.jpg</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="856" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="u">https://www.ifad.org/documents/38714170/41115388/BD_CCRIP_IA+report.pdf/863f487a-105a-f286-2f2d-2b9a8860cc3b</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="999" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">VIRTUA40</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="999" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">VTLSSORT0010*0030*0080*0350*0390*0900*1000*2450*2600*3000*4900*5200*6500*6501*6502*6503*6504*7000*7001*7730*8520*8560*8561*9992</subfield></datafield></record><record><leader>02860nab a2200325 a 4500</leader><controlfield tag="001">vtls000016501</controlfield><controlfield tag="003">IFAD</controlfield><controlfield tag="005">20190513113500.0</controlfield><controlfield tag="008">190513 2018                  000 0 eng d</controlfield><datafield tag="035" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">IF000016501</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="039" ind1=" " ind2="9"><subfield code="a">201905131135</subfield><subfield code="b">vaids</subfield><subfield code="y">201905131113</subfield><subfield code="z">vaids</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="090" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">S2256 26 2018 N.3</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="100" ind1="1" ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Cavatassi, R.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="245" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Community-based Forestry Development Project in Southern States (DECOFOS):</subfield><subfield code="b">Mexico</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="260" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="b">IFAD</subfield><subfield code="c">2018</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="300" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">40 pp.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="490" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">IFAD Impact Assessment</subfield><subfield code="v">2018 N.3</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="520" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">The territory of Mexico is covered by forests and wildland up to about 73% of the total territory (World Bank, 2015 and CONAFOR, 2012). This corresponds to around 140 million hectares, 80% of which are owned by communities and ejidos. Starting from the '80s, Mexico has experienced one of the largest deforestation rates in Latin America due to a number of complex socio-economic and political reasons which have reduced incentives to the sustainable use of forests with negative consequences for their long term conservation (Segura, 2000).&#xD;
To address and overcome problems linked to deforestation and forest degradation, the Community-based Forestry Development Project in Southern States (Desarrollo Comunitario Forestal en los Estados del Sur – DECOFOS) was designed and implemented from March 2011 to September 2016 with contribution from the Government of Mexico, IFAD, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and project beneficiaries. The project had two main components. The first component was mainly meant to raise awareness of climate change and of sustainable use and management of natural resources through trainings and capacity development. This component could be instrumental to achieving impacts when combined with the second component which had a more tangible connotation. The second component, indeed, consisted on promoting sustainable management and exploitation of forest and natural resources through reforestation, adoption of agroforestry and of good environmental practices, supporting and facilitating business enterprises through the provision of technical and financial support to the start-up of micro-entrepreneurial projects and small-businesses enterprises.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">IMPACT ASSESSMENT</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">ENVIRONMENT</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">FORESTRY DEVELOPMENT</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">DEFORESTRATION</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="700" ind1="1" ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Alfani, F. et al.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="773" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="w">IF000016494</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="852" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">E-Lib</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="856" ind1=" " ind2="8"><subfield code="u">http://library2018.ifad.org:8080/16483.jpg</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="856" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="u">https://www.ifad.org/documents/38714170/41096508/MX_DECOFOS_IA+report.pdf/d6815458-8f90-39b0-793a-cfbf9cb82211</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="999" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">VIRTUA40</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="999" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">VTLSSORT0010*0030*0080*0350*0390*0900*1000*2450*2600*3000*4900*5200*6500*6501*6502*6503*6504*7000*7730*8520*8560*8561*9992</subfield></datafield></record><record><leader>02519nab a2200325 a 4500</leader><controlfield tag="001">vtls000016504</controlfield><controlfield tag="003">IFAD</controlfield><controlfield tag="005">20190513120700.0</controlfield><controlfield tag="008">190513 2018                  000 0 eng d</controlfield><datafield tag="035" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">IF000016504</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="039" ind1=" " ind2="9"><subfield code="a">201905131207</subfield><subfield code="b">vaids</subfield><subfield code="y">201905131207</subfield><subfield code="z">vaids</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="090" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">S2256 26 2018 N.6</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="100" ind1="1" ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Garbero, A.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="245" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Guangxi integrated agricultural development project (GIADP):</subfield><subfield code="b">China</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="260" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="b">IFAD</subfield><subfield code="c">2018</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="300" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">72 pp.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="490" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">IFAD Impact Assessment</subfield><subfield code="v">2018 N.6</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="520" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Improving market access of smallholder farmers in the developing world is considered an important approach to moving them out of poverty and increasing their economic mobility. In China, rural poverty has declined at a phenomenal speed within just two decades, and much of this success story is attributable to rapid income growth in rural areas. Thus, having a good understanding of how development efforts in rural China may help alleviate poverty and improving economic mobility is of particular interest for policy, as they are instrumental in informing future project design and scaling-up of success stories to other regions in China as well as to other countries.&#xD;
The Guangxi Integrated Agricultural Development Project (GIADP) is an example of a development effort aimed at increasing rural household income in China through three project components: community infrastructure development, agricultural production and marketing support, and rural environmental improvement. The project was approved by the Executive Board of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in December 2011, entered into effect in January 2012, and ran until March 2017. Interventions delivered covered three main components: community infrastructure improvements, agricultural production and marketing support, and interventions aimed at preserving the rural environment.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">IMPACT ASSESSMENT</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">COMMERCIAL FARMING</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">SUSTAINABILITY</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">SMALL HOLDER</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="700" ind1="1" ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Songsermsawas, T.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="773" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="w">IF000016494</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="852" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">E-Lib</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="856" ind1=" " ind2="8"><subfield code="u">http://library2018.ifad.org:8080/16486.jpg</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="856" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="u">https://www.ifad.org/documents/38714170/41096302/CN_GIADP_IA+report.pdf/14a17e7e-8de8-3c00-0db3-67cbd38a22b1</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="999" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">VIRTUA40</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="999" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">VTLSSORT0010*0030*0080*0350*0390*0900*1000*2450*2600*3000*4900*5200*6500*6501*6502*6503*6504*7000*7730*8520*8560*8561*9992</subfield></datafield></record><record><leader>03768nab a2200337 a 4500</leader><controlfield tag="001">vtls000016503</controlfield><controlfield tag="003">IFAD</controlfield><controlfield tag="005">20190513115400.0</controlfield><controlfield tag="008">190513 2018                  000 0 eng d</controlfield><datafield tag="035" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">IF000016503</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="039" ind1=" " ind2="9"><subfield code="a">201905131154</subfield><subfield code="b">vaids</subfield><subfield code="c">201905131153</subfield><subfield code="d">vaids</subfield><subfield code="y">201905131153</subfield><subfield code="z">vaids</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="090" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">S2256 26 2018 N.5</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="100" ind1="1" ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Kafle, K.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="245" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">High value agriculture project in hill and mountain areas (HVAP):</subfield><subfield code="b">Nepal</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="260" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="b">IFAD</subfield><subfield code="c">2018</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="300" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">64 pp.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="490" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">IFAD Impact Assessment</subfield><subfield code="v">2018 N.5</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="520" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">This report assesses the impact of the High Value Agriculture Project in Hill and Mountain Areas (HVAP) of Nepal co-financed by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the Government of Nepal (GoN), and the SNV Netherlands Development Organization. The project was implemented between February 2011 and September 2018, and aimed at reducing rural poverty and improving food security in the remote hill and mountainous areas of the landlocked state. Nepal's geographical landscape presents numerous challenges to local economic growth and rural development. The livelihood of the people living in Nepal's rugged landscape is often characterized by low agricultural productivity, and limited access to markets and services.&#xD;
HVAP is a unique project both in terms of its geographical coverage and its type of interventions provided to the target groups. Its unique feature is the inclusive value chain development component which links different actors in the agricultural value chain including producers, retailers, wholesalers, input suppliers, technical service providers, credit and commerce groups, and government line ministries and agencies. In addition, the project helps strengthen the agricultural service delivery by facilitating the linkages among producers, crop and livestock extension speacialists, and technical service providers such as agrovets, para-vets, and plant protectionists through the service market strengthening component.&#xD;
The project covers seven hill and mountaneous districts in Karnali Province (formerly the Mid-Western Development Region)1 and identifies seven agricultural commodities as high value commodities in this area: apple, ginger, vegetable seeds, off-season vegetables turmeric, timur (Sichuan pepper), and goat. To ensure gender representativeness and promite social cohesiveness, all support services are delivered through producer organizations (PO) which are local producer groups or co-operatives that are representative of women and ethinc minorities in the area. The project supported smallholder farmers in 456 POs by strengthening their access to input markets, output markets, and service markets as well as their skills and capacity to produce market-oriented high value agricultural commodities. As part of the awareness and skill development training, the project provided a 30-day business literacy curriculum to both female and male farmers. The project also offered technical support to service markets through providing technical training activities and market information to service providers.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">IMPACT ASSESSMENT</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">FARMING SYSTEMS</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">ECONOMIC GROWTH</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">POVERTY</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="700" ind1="1" ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Krah, K,</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="700" ind1="1" ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Songsermsawas, T.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="773" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="w">IF000016494</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="852" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">E-Lib</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="856" ind1=" " ind2="8"><subfield code="u">http://library2018.ifad.org:8080/16485.jpg</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="856" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="u">https://www.ifad.org/documents/38714170/41096781/NP_HVAP_IA+report.pdf/ddef40a6-c0c9-6778-1434-96156b9104c5</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="999" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">VIRTUA40</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="999" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">VTLSSORT0010*0030*0080*0350*0390*0900*1000*2450*2600*3000*4900*5200*6500*6501*6502*6503*6504*7000*7001*7730*8520*8560*8561*9992</subfield></datafield></record><record><leader>02577ncb a2200325 a 4500</leader><controlfield tag="001">vtls000016497</controlfield><controlfield tag="003">IFAD</controlfield><controlfield tag="005">20190513160000.0</controlfield><controlfield tag="008">190513 2017                  000 0 eng d</controlfield><datafield tag="035" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">IF000016497</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="039" ind1=" " ind2="9"><subfield code="a">201905131600</subfield><subfield code="b">vaids</subfield><subfield code="c">201905131559</subfield><subfield code="d">vaids</subfield><subfield code="c">201905131558</subfield><subfield code="d">vaids</subfield><subfield code="c">201905131008</subfield><subfield code="d">vaids</subfield><subfield code="y">201905131005</subfield><subfield code="z">vaids</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="090" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">S2256 26 2017 2</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="100" ind1="1" ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Ring, H.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="245" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Impact evaluation of the programme supporting development of Menabe and Melaky regions in Madagascar</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="260" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="b">IFAD</subfield><subfield code="c">2017</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="300" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">136 pp.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="520" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Farmers in western Madagascar live in an arid region that makes it difficult to survive on their own production. As in many other regions in less developed countries, there is a big initiative to improve agricultural production. Agricultural development is particularly important for a country like Madagascar, with 77.8% of the population living in rural settings (Rasambainarivo &amp; Ranaivoarivelo, 2003). In such a dry region, it is important to understand whether large-scale investments in irrigation infrastructure can improve outcomes for smallholder farmers. To do so, we focused on crop yields, cropping in multiple seasons and improved agricultural practices. We identified these outcomes as key indicators of improved agricultural livelihoods.&#xD;
Appui au Développement du Menabe et du Melaky (AD2M) farmers had the opportunity to change the way they grow crops. The programme created new irrigation infrastructure in areas that had not been irrigated, and rehabilitated existing irrigation infrastructure when possible. The irrigation allowed farmers to use better agricultural techniques. For example, they potentially could manage water flow to crops better during the primary growing season, and could support a second growing season with the more efficient water supply. We would expect crop yields to increase if farmers followed these techniques.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">IMPACT ASSESSMENT</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">IRRIGATION SYSTEMS</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">CROP PRODUCTIONS</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">LAND ACCESS</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="700" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Morey, M. et al.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="773" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="w">IF000016494</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="773" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="t">IF000016494</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="852" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">E-Lib</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="856" ind1=" " ind2="8"><subfield code="u">http://library2018.ifad.org:8080/16480.jpg</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="856" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="u">https://www.ifad.org/documents/38714170/41113765/MG_AD2M_IA+report.pdf/f0dee52c-908c-6adf-56da-40fb44ce9580</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="999" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">VIRTUA40</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="999" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">VTLSSORT0010*7731*0030*0080*0350*0390*0900*1000*2450*2600*3000*7000*5200*6500*6501*6502*6503*6504*7730*8520*8560*8561*9992</subfield></datafield></record><record><leader>03188nab a2200325 a 4500</leader><controlfield tag="001">vtls000016496</controlfield><controlfield tag="003">IFAD</controlfield><controlfield tag="005">20190513110200.0</controlfield><controlfield tag="008">190513 2017                  000 0 eng d</controlfield><datafield tag="035" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">IF000016496</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="039" ind1=" " ind2="9"><subfield code="a">201905131102</subfield><subfield code="b">vaids</subfield><subfield code="c">201905131020</subfield><subfield code="d">vaids</subfield><subfield code="c">201905130947</subfield><subfield code="d">vaids</subfield><subfield code="c">201905130946</subfield><subfield code="d">vaids</subfield><subfield code="y">201905130945</subfield><subfield code="z">vaids</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="090" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">S2256 26 2017 N.1</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="100" ind1="1" ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Bonilla, J.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="245" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Impact evaluation of the smallholder dairy commercialization programme in Kenya</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="260" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="b">IFAD</subfield><subfield code="c">2017</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="300" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">66 pp.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="490" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">IFAD Impact Assessment</subfield><subfield code="v">2017 N.1</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="520" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">The dairy sector in Kenya is one of the largest and most developed in Sub-Saharan Africa, accounting for four percent of its gross domestic product. Despite high production volumes, the sector is still dominated by smallholder farmers who rely on livestock for income and food security. Dairy farmers face a number of barriers to increased profitability, including animal diseases, lack of access to artificial insemination and other veterinary services, high costs of improved technologies, such as silage equipment, inadequate access to markets, poor rural infrastructure and unsteady supply of quality animal fodder.&#xD;
The Smallholder Dairy Commercialisation Programme (SDCP) was funded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and implemented by the Government of Kenya from 2005 – 2015. It was designed to reach 600 dairy groups (24,000 smallholder dairy farmers) in nine counties. SDCP provided training to dairy farmers to build their enterprise, managerial and organisational skills. Aside from training, the programme also aimed to enhance dairy farming productivity and reduce production costs through demonstration, field days and grants. To strengthen market linkages, SDCP invested in improving road infrastructure and conducted additional training on milk-handling practices and value-added opportunities.&#xD;
The programme identified three main areas where barriers to improving dairy income potentially operate: dairy group activities, household production and market intermediaries. Programme designers hypothesised that increasing net dairy income for smallholder farmers can occur through four primary contextual factors (1) increasing milk production; (2) increasing milk prices; (3) decreasing the costs of producing milk; and (4) decreasing the transaction costs of participation in input and output markets. They assumed that increased net income will lead to improved food security and increased participation by women and marginalised communities.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">IMPACT ASSESSMENT</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">DAIRY</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">LIVESTOCK FARM</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">SMALL HOLDER</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">FOOD SECURITY</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="700" ind1="1" ind2=" "><subfield code="a">McCarthy, N. et al.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="773" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="w">IF000016494</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="852" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">E-Lib</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="856" ind1=" " ind2="8"><subfield code="u">http://library2018.ifad.org:8080/16479.jpg</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="856" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="u">https://www.ifad.org/documents/38714170/41113497/KE_SCDP_IA+report.pdf/183801b7-c1f5-0722-56aa-f2d796984e08</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="999" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">VIRTUA40</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="999" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">VTLSSORT0010*4900*7730*0030*0080*0350*0390*0900*1000*2450*2600*3000*5200*6500*6501*6502*6503*6504*7000*8520*8560*8561*9992</subfield></datafield></record><record><leader>03262nab a2200325 a 4500</leader><controlfield tag="001">vtls000016506</controlfield><controlfield tag="003">IFAD</controlfield><controlfield tag="005">20190513124800.0</controlfield><controlfield tag="008">190513 2018                  000 0 eng d</controlfield><datafield tag="035" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">IF000016506</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="039" ind1=" " ind2="9"><subfield code="a">201905131248</subfield><subfield code="b">vaids</subfield><subfield code="y">201905131238</subfield><subfield code="z">vaids</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="090" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">S2256 26 2018 N.8</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="100" ind1="1" ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Arslan, A.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="245" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Irrigated rice production enhancement project (IRPEP):</subfield><subfield code="b">Philippines</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="260" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="b">IFAD</subfield><subfield code="c">2018</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="300" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">60 pp.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="490" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">IFAD Impact Assessment</subfield><subfield code="v">2018 N.8</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="520" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Smallholder rice farming is central to poverty reduction, food security, and rural development in the Philippines. Currently, rice affordability is threatened by the country's protectionist approach to rice imports and low production efficiency. One key issue is that around 41 percent of the country's irrigable land is not irrigated. Moreover, many irrigation systems are suggested to be poorly managed with unequal water distribution.&#xD;
The Irrigated Rice Production Enhancement Project (IRPEP) was implemented in three regions (VI, VII and X) of the Philippines between 2010-2015. It was designed to improve rice productivity and smallholder livelihoods by strengthening canal irrigation infrastructure of Communal Irrigation Systems (CIS), improving the capacity of the Irrigators' Associations (IAs) that manage the CIS, and offering complementary marketing support, Farmer Field Schools, and emergency seed buffer stocks. As the government provides FFS and buffer stocks to farmers across the country, we focus the assessment on the irrigation and marketing activities only. We define the impact indicators based on IRPEP's theory of change, which maps the inputs and activities of the project to outcomes and impacts through various channels.&#xD;
The analysis is based on quantitative data from 2,104 households and 113 IAs covering beneficiary and non-beneficiary groups, along with qualitative data from project and IA staff. We estimate IRPEP's impact by comparing beneficiary and non-beneficiary households and IAs using statistical matching techniques to ensure a clean and unbaised comparison. We then use the qualitative data to try to identify the underlying factors that shaped the results. We particularly focus our analysis on regional heterogeneities in impacts because of the considerable differences between the three project regions. The main difference between regions stems from their varying levels of exposure to extreme weather events (e.g. super typhoons), as Region VIII, and to a lesser extent Region VI, experienced significant extreme weather damage during the project's implementation.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">IMPACT ASSESSMENT</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">CROP PRODUCTIONS</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">RUTAL DEVELOPMENT</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="700" ind1="1" ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Higgins, D.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="773" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="w">IF000016494</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="852" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">E-Lib</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="856" ind1=" " ind2="8"><subfield code="u">http://library2018.ifad.org:8080/16488.jpg</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="856" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="u">https://www.ifad.org/documents/38714170/41096985/PH_IRPEP_IA+report.pdf/48dd167b-17fc-3f56-701a-053ac86c5b11</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="999" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">VIRTUA40</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="999" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">VTLSSORT0010*0030*0080*0350*0390*0900*1000*2450*2600*3000*4900*5200*6500*6501*6502*6503*6504*7000*7730*8520*8560*8561*9992</subfield></datafield></record><record><leader>03479nab a2200325 a 4500</leader><controlfield tag="001">vtls000016502</controlfield><controlfield tag="003">IFAD</controlfield><controlfield tag="005">20190513114000.0</controlfield><controlfield tag="008">190513 2018                  000 0 eng d</controlfield><datafield tag="035" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">IF000016502</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="039" ind1=" " ind2="9"><subfield code="a">201905131140</subfield><subfield code="b">vaids</subfield><subfield code="c">201905131135</subfield><subfield code="d">vaids</subfield><subfield code="y">201905131134</subfield><subfield code="z">vaids</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="090" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">S2256 26 2018 N.4</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="100" ind1="1" ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Cavatassi, R.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="245" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Livestock and Pasture Development Project (LPDP):</subfield><subfield code="b">Tajikistan</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="260" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="b">IFAD</subfield><subfield code="c">2018</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="300" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">44 pp.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="490" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">IFAD Impact Assessment</subfield><subfield code="v">2018 N.4</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="520" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">The Republic of Tajikistan is a land locked country, where most of the territory (93%) is occupied by&#xD;
mountains. Poverty is quite widespread with about half of the country’s population living below the&#xD;
poverty line. The poorest people in the country reside in the Khatlon region, where 78 per cent of the population lives under the national poverty line and where land is degraded, the availability of inputs and credit is limited, irrigation facilities are lacking, and access to improved technologies and&#xD;
markets is poor (World Bank, 2015). About 50 per cent of the population depends on agriculture for livelihood, and most farmers lack&#xD;
access to adequate inputs, resources, technology and markets. Livestock is a key part of the&#xD;
agricultural sector and it is of critical importance in the livelihood strategy of poor rural households&#xD;
in Tajikistan.&#xD;
The pasture management system in Tajikistan remains largely unchanged since Soviet times with the exception that the lowest rung in the management system (corporate farms) no longer has adequate resources for pasture upkeep nor an adequate management system. The inadequacy of such a centralized management system is reflected in the overexploitation of pasture which has led to a vicious cycle of ever-lower animal yields and rural income, which is triggered by the legitimate will of farmers to increase their livestock production by adding animal units. This, in turn, has created a greater demand for feed, leading to a decrease in the feed per animal ratio, to a deterioration of the grazing land and to a further fall in animal weight. As a result, the rise in livestock inventories&#xD;
coupled with the fall in feed supplies has meant the dramatic fall of livestock productivity, low milk&#xD;
and meat yields and land degradation in the country, further worsening poverty among households.&#xD;
To address and overcome these problems, the Government of Tajikistan launched the Livestock and&#xD;
Pasture Development Project (LPDP) in August 2011, a project financed jointly by IFAD and the&#xD;
Government of the Republic of Tajikistan. The project had the goal of reducing poverty in the&#xD;
Khatlon region, increasing the nutritional status and incomes of rural poor households by boosting&#xD;
livestock productivity through the improvement of the productive capacity of pastures.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">IMPACT ASSESSMENT</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">LIVESTOCK FARM</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">PASTURE IMPROVEMENT</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="650" ind1=" " ind2="7"><subfield code="a">FOOD SECURITY</subfield><subfield code="2">AGROVOC</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="700" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">Mallia, P.</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="773" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="w">IF000016494</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="852" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">E-Lib</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="856" ind1=" " ind2="8"><subfield code="u">http://library2018.ifad.org:8080/16484.jpg</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="856" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="u">https://www.ifad.org/documents/38714170/41114919/TJ_LPDP_IA+report.pdf/46a3c493-b024-e1b2-3f3a-786255cdc035</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="999" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">VIRTUA40</subfield></datafield><datafield tag="999" ind1=" " ind2=" "><subfield code="a">VTLSSORT0010*7000*0030*0080*0350*0390*0900*1000*2450*2600*3000*4900*5200*6500*6501*6502*6503*6504*7730*8520*8560*8561*9992</subfield></datafield></record></collection>
